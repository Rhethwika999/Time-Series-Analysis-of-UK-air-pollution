7. **Validation**: Validated the models using RMSE, MAPE, and other statistical metrics.

## Results üîë

### Univariate Analysis
- **SARIMA Model**:
  - Best model for Greenwich: SARIMA(1, 1, 1)(1, 1, 1, 12)
  - Best model for Hillington: SARIMA(5, 1, 1)(2, 2, 2, 12)
  - Forecasted NO2 levels show a general decline, with Hillington having higher levels than Greenwich.

### Multivariate Analysis
- **VAR Model**:
  - Humidity showed a significant short-term impact on NO2 levels.
  - Other weather parameters had minimal and transient effects.

- **VECM Model**:
  - No long-term equilibrium relationship found between NO2 levels and weather parameters like temperature and sea level pressure.

## Conclusion üèÜ

The study reveals a significant decline in NO2 levels in both Greenwich and Hillington, particularly after 2019, likely due to the COVID-19 lockdowns. The SARIMA model effectively forecasts future NO2 levels, indicating continued improvement in air quality. While humidity impacts NO2 levels in the short term, no long-term relationship with weather parameters was found. These findings can inform policy-making and targeted interventions to further reduce air pollution.

## Future Scope ü§î

- **Policy Implementation**: Support for Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEVs) and Clean Air Zones (CAZs).
- **Public Transport and Infrastructure**: Investments in low-carbon buses and cycling infrastructure.
- **Further Research**: Explore additional weather parameters and their impact on air quality.
